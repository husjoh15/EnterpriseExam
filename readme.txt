I did not have enough time to comment the code, but I don't feel like I have code that is hard to understand. I would comment more code if I had more time. 
I think I used 37 hourse on this exam, had alot of problems with arquillian early on, but managed to fix it after a while. It was a very fun exam, and I wish I had time to do all the exercises, because it was fun to work with.
